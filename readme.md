# Robust Barrier Coverage in the IoT - Matheus Centa/Joao Rocha Oliveira

## Matheus Centa / Joao Rocha Oliveira

### Clarifications for GitHub:
This project was developed as part of the "INF421 - Analysis and Design of Algorithms" course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. The directions and subject is given here.

### Usage:
This project is executed by running the Main.java in the ``/bin`` folder with two program arguments ``<mode>`` and ``<file>`` (the order of arguments is important): 
1. **mode**: the first argument is either ``-hm`` for a homogeneous lifetime network as input or ``-ht`` for a heterogeneous lifetimes network;
2. **file**: the second is the input file name with the extension. The input file must be placed in the ``\input`` directory.

For example, to test the program on the first example network, we execute the following line at the terminal: <br>
```$ java -jar Main.jar -hm sensornetwork0.doc```, while on the ``\bin`` directory. 

The input and output follow the following guidelines:
* **input**: this is a text file in the ``\input`` directory which represents an instance of the K-Barrier Coverage Problem. <br>
         The formating is as follows: <br>
>	 	n                                            (integer - number of sensors)
>	 	K                                            (integer - coverage redundancy)
>		X_max                                        (real number - the right wall coordinate)
>		Y_max                                        (real number - the coordinate of the upper border of the region)
>		R                                            (real number - the individual sensor coverage radius)
>		a list of all x-coordinates of the n sensors (list of n real numbers within 0 to X_max)
>		a list of all y-coordinates of the n sensors (list of n real numbers within 0 to Y_max)
>		c for every sensor plus a starting and ending value which will be ignored (list of n+2 integers)

* **output**: the output is a schedule printed to ``stdin``, presented as a list of intervals and the sensor paths active during those interval e.g. <br>
>                 ( 2,  5): [1, 2, 6]
>                 	      [3, 4, 7]
			    
means that for the interval from time 2 to 5, the sensors paths 1---2---6 and 3---4---7 will be active. <br>
The output also consists of the network lifetime and the processing time (not counting reading and printing).
